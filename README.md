# DeppTrialTwitterAnalysis

I watched the testimony in the Johnny Depp v. Amber Heard trial where the guy from Berkeley Research Group explained his methodology, showed his final graphs, and said they were paid $600/hr to do it. I was pretty sure that amount of work could be done in an afternoon, so I gave it a go and it took way less time that even I thought. <br>

### Methodology
I wasn't going to pay to use twitter's full archive, so I just used the last 7 days as that's free. In fairness, this expense would have played a role in the high price tag. To mimic the amount of analytical work actually done, I used an hourly breakdown of the last 7 days instead of the daily breakdown presented in court. <br>
I got this data from twitter's search api
